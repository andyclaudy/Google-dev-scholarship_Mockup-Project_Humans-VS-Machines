##Translating a mockup to HTML##

This project is  part of the Google Developer Challenge Scholarship: Front-End Web Dev. On the specific lesson we were given an image (Humans VS Machines.jpeg) and had to construct a webpage that looked identical to that specific image. Below is the description and requests of the project.

##Project Overview##
I'll be giving you a mockup of a website (and a copy of the text in it). It's going to be your job to recreate it with HTML.

You're going to see some formatting you haven't encountered before, so you'll need to use a resource, like the MDN element reference, to research new elements.

##Project Instructions##
Review the Article to Mockup Project Rubric.

Download and unzip mockup-to-article.zip in the Supporting Materials section, below. You'll find index.html, the article mockup image (blog-mockup.pdf) and a file called reflections.txt inside.
Use what you've learned about web development so far to edit index.html so that it looks exactly like the mockup image. You will need to use new elements, which means that you'll need to research and experiment! Note: You can recreate the mockup without using a single <br> tag! You don't need to worry about line breaks. The text should naturally wrap depending on how wide the window is.
When you've finished building the article, open up reflections.txt. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development in reflections.txt. Answer the following questions:
What new skills have you learned?
What has been easy?
What has been difficult?
How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
